# Work Day Scheduler

In this project I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I also utilized the Moment.js library to work with date and time.


## User Story

AS an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.


## User Instructions

When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
When I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event.
When I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist.
